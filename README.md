# 2STP Rework

2STP is a handy 2-step verification tool, but it had [stoped support](http://www.thomasrzhao.com/2stp-support/end-of-support/) because of the developer hired by Apple. I want to use it, so I decided to start learning iOS develop and make a new one.

## Specification

### Export Accounts feature

The file generated by the Export Accounts feature is an encrypted archive.
Specifically, the account data is first archived with NSKeyedArchiver with a binary output format. Then, the resulting archived data is fed into [RNCryptor](https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor) along with the user-provided passcode.
More details of the precise format and instructions on how to decode it can be found [here](./references/OTPToken.swift).
